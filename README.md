# ITERATIVE AI DEVELOPMENT

> AI is not a finished product.  
> It is a process of iteration, validation, and responsibility.

![Lesson preview](assets/AIkdemy_preview.png)

**Iterative AI Development** is an **interactive learning module** designed during my experience as an **Instructional Designer & AI Author at Studi**.

This repository presents a **complete e-learning lesson** dedicated to teaching **iterative development of Artificial Intelligence components**, combining:
- active pedagogy,
- business-oriented scenarios,
- educational UX design,
- and industry-aligned AI best practices.

It is conceived as both a **teaching resource** and a **reference case study** for AI education.

## 🌍 Pedagogical Vision

AI is often taught as a collection of models and algorithms.  
In real-world environments, AI development is instead:
- experimental,
- incremental,
- data-constrained,
- and inherently responsible.

This project promotes a clear mindset:

👉 **You don’t “build” AI once — you iterate it.**

The goal is to train learners to:
- think in **increments**,
- validate value early,
- reduce technical and product risk,
- align AI decisions with business objectives,
- avoid high-risk monolithic approaches.
